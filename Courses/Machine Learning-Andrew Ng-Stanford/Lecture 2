Lecture 2.1 Linear regression with one variable -- Model representation

Using a dataset of Housing Prices (Portland, OR)

Supervised Learning: Given the "right answer" for each example in the data.
Regression Problem: Predict real-valued output
Classification Problem: Discrete-valued output

Training set of housing prices (Portland,OR)

Size in feet^2 (x)   |    Prices ($) in 1000's (y)
        2104                     460
        1416                     232

Notation:
m = Number of training examples
x's = "input" variable / features
y's = "output" variable / "target" variable
(x,y) -> one training example
(x^(i),y^(i)) -> ith training example

x^(1) = 2104     y^(1) = 460
x^(2) = 1416     y^(2) = 232
